Hey :D 
My name is Ace and I'm a current student at the College of Engineering at Wayne State University obtaining a B.S. in Computer Science :sun_with_face: 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Machine Learning model that generates poems in the style and prose of famous artists such as Ernest Hemingway, Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. :scroll:
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Markov Chains and how to generate a sequence of words from vector representations of such words using Word2Vec. :8ball:
