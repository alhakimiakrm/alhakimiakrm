My name is Ace and I'm a current student at the College of Engineering at Wayne State University obtaining a B.S. in Computer Science :sun_with_face:
  
- :scroll: Iâ€™m currently working on a Machine Learning model that generates poems in the style and prose of famous artists such as Ernest Hemingway, Robert Frost and Maya Angelou.
